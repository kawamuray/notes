== Read/Write JS object fields from Rust

Context: Despite that https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/0.2.63/wasm_bindgen/struct.JsValue.html:[JsValue] provides various type conversion methods, the way accessing JS object like `{abc: "def"}` isn't mentioned anywhere.

Use https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/js_sys/Reflect/index.html:[Reflect] from `js_sys` crate.

[source,rust]
----
let value = Reflect::get(&obj, &JsValue::from_str("index"));

== `wasm_bindgen` doesn't support `Vec<_>`

Context: The sruct containing `Vec<_>` in its field doesn't allowed to be annotated with `#[wasm_bindgen]`.

As explained in this https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/111:[issue] currently it is not supported.
There are many workarounds suggested but seems like the way using https://github.com/cloudflare/serde-wasm-bindgen:[serde-wasm-bindgen] is the most promising as of now. Or, just manually acccess individual fields with the above `Reflect`.
