== Edit imagePullPolicy (or whatever object configuration) of a running deployment

`kubectl edit deployment my-deployment`


== Run minikube on Mac

Context: To run minikube locally on Mac, it requires docker (containerd) runtime. However, docker desktop for mac is now a subscription license.

We can use https://github.com/lima-vm/lima[lima] to create a lightweight VM and run linux image inside, so that we can get a semi-locally running docker environment without docker desktop.

[source,sh]
----
limactl start --name=default template://docker
docker context create lima-default --docker "host=unix:///Users/xyz/.lima/default/sock/docker.sock"
docker context use lima-default
----

We can start minikube on the above docker environment inside lima.

[source,sh]
----
minikube start --container-runtime containerd
----

To re-create the whole minikube environment:

[source,sh]
----
minikube delete --all --purge
----

== Run minikube on Mac with Docker Desktop for Mac

1. Can(should) use docker as runtime
2. Need to disable InUserNamespace feature gate to avoid `Exiting due to RUNTIME_ENABLE: inUserNamespace must not be true for docker` error.

[source,sh]
----
minikube start --container-runtime=docker --network-plugin=cni --cni=cilium --feature-gates=KubeletInUserNamespace=false
----

== Let minikube to pull locally-built docker image

Context: The minikube environment started with the above command does not refer a locally (on lima) running docker engine as a source of images to pull.

Straightforward solution is to build (push) image on a docker daemon that is managed by minikube, but it is available only if we specify `docker` as the runtime:

[source,sh]
----
minikube start --container-runtime docker
----

which actually fails and seems impossible on lima.

Alternatively, it seems possible to use a manually started docker image registry and let minikube to refer it as a source of images: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42564058/how-to-use-local-docker-images-with-minikube

[source,sh]
----
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name local-registry registry:2
docker tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image
docker push localhost:5000/my-image
----

Attempting to load image directly (from docker) w/o pushing it to local registry seems to fail.

[source,sh]
----
minikube image load my-image
‚ùó  The image 'my-image' was not found; unable to add it to cache.
----

Attempting to run a k8s deployment directly referring local registry also seems to fail (perhaps because this localhost points to mac's localhost, rather than it of lima VM?)

[source,sh]
----
kubectl create deployment my-example --image=localhost:5000/my-image
----

We need to let minikube "load" the image manually to make it work.

[source,sh]
----
minikube image load localhost:5000/my-image
----

It is also required to change `imagePullPolicy` setting to `Never`. by `minikube edit`.

== NetworkPolicy on minikube

Context: Configuring NetworkPolicy on minikube seems to have no effect.

https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/network_policy/

By default, minikube isn't configured with any of network plugin, which is required to make a NetworkPolicy take an effect.
It issues no error, warnings, allows to load NetworkPolicy, but it just doesn't do anything silently.

To make NetworkPolicy take an effect on minikube, we need to start minikube with `--cni calico`.

[source,sh]
----
minikube start --container-runtime containerd --cni calico
----

== Authenticate a remote k8s cluster for an image registry

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/

[source,sh]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>
----

and we need to set a deployment config to use the created cred explicitly:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: private-reg-container
    image: <your-private-image>
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: regcred
----
