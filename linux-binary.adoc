== setcap disables LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Context: jtaskstats execution failed by `libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` despite I set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` properly.

`man ld.so` says:
----
o  Using the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Except if the executable is a set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary, in which case it is ignored.
----

Apparently by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9843178/linux-capabilities-setcap-seems-to-disable-ld-library-path[security reason]. LD_PRELOAD as well.
